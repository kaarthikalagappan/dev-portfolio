# Portfolio Website
### A portfolio website made from Gatsby and an interest to learn React.

I made this website as a way to learn React and chose to use Gatsby as it leveraged React and seemed like a sufficient tool to build a static portfolio website.

A live version of the website can be viewed at [https://kaarthikalagappan.dev](https://kaarthikalagappan.dev). Data regarding the author is located in the `src/assets/` folder named `author_details.json`. Changing the values there will update the website fields that use that data.
